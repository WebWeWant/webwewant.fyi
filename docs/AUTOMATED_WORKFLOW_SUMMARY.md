# Automated Want Processing Workflow

This document summarizes the complete automated workflow implementation for processing want submissions from Netlify Forms to the Web We Want site.

## üéØ Overview

The automated Want processing workflow is a comprehensive GitHub-based system that:

1. **Receives** webhook submissions from Netlify Forms
2. **Creates** GitHub issues automatically with structured data
3. **Processes** both new submissions and existing backlog issues
4. **Assigns** issues to GitHub Copilot for intelligent processing
5. **Analyzes** submissions for spam, relevance, and duplicates
6. **Generates** properly formatted want files and pull requests

## üìÅ Implementation Files

### Workflow & Automation
- **`.github/workflows/process-want-submission.yml`** - Main GitHub Actions workflow
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/automated-want-submission.md`** - Issue template for webhook-created issues
- **`.github/instructions/wants-processing.instructions.md`** - Comprehensive processing instructions for GitHub Copilot

### Scripts & Utilities
- **`scripts/wantProcessor.js`** - Core logic for want file generation and duplicate detection
- **`scripts/testWorkflow.js`** - Testing script with multiple scenarios

### Documentation
- **`docs/NETLIFY_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`** - Complete webhook configuration guide
- **`docs/MANUAL_PROCESSING.md`** - Guide for processing existing issues manually

## üîÑ Workflow Process

### 1. New Submissions: Form Submission ‚Üí Webhook
- User submits want via Netlify form
- Netlify triggers webhook to GitHub repository
- Webhook payload includes all form data and metadata

### 2. Existing Issues: Manual Trigger
- Comment `/process-want` on any existing issue
- Workflow detects comment and triggers processing
- Same analysis process as new submissions

### 3. Issue Creation/Processing
- GitHub Actions workflow receives trigger
- Creates new issue (webhooks) or processes existing issue (comments)
- Assigns issue to `@github-copilot[bot]`
- Adds labels: `needs-review`, `auto-generated`

### 4. Copilot Processing
Copilot follows a 5-step analysis process:

#### Step 1: Spam Detection ‚úÖ
- Analyzes content for spam indicators
- Checks for promotional content, generic language, suspicious formatting
- **If spam**: Closes issue with "spam" label
- **If legitimate**: Proceeds to relevance check

#### Step 2: Relevance Check ‚úÖ
- Determines if submission relates to web platform evolution
- Validates against Web We Want mission (HTML, CSS, JS, browsers)
- **If off-topic**: Labels "off-topic" and closes with explanation
- **If relevant**: Adds "want" label and continues

#### Step 3: Technology Classification ‚úÖ
- Assigns appropriate technology labels:
  - `html`, `css`, `javascript`
  - `accessibility`, `devtools`, `browsers`
  - `web-apps`, `forms`, `typography`
  - `user-experience`, `urls`, `extensions`

#### Step 4: Duplicate Detection ‚úÖ
- Searches existing wants using tag filtering and content similarity
- Uses intelligent scoring based on tag overlap and content analysis
- **If duplicate**: Labels "duplicate" with link to existing want
- **If unique**: Proceeds to want creation

#### Step 5: Want File Creation ‚úÖ
- Generates new file: `/wants/{submissionId}.md`
- Creates proper frontmatter with all metadata
- Enhances content for clarity and completeness
- Adds related links to specifications and proposals
- Creates pull request referencing original issue

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Configuration
All workflow files are already in place. Ensure:
- GitHub Actions are enabled
- GitHub Copilot has repository access
- Repository allows workflows and issue creation

### 2. Netlify Webhook Setup
Follow the detailed guide in `docs/NETLIFY_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`:

1. **Configure webhook URL**: `https://api.github.com/repos/WebWeWant/webwewant.fyi/dispatches`
2. **Add required headers** with GitHub token
3. **Set up payload template** with form field mapping
4. **Test integration** with sample submission

### 3. GitHub Token (Optional)
The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` by default. For enhanced permissions:
- Create Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
- Add as repository secret: `PROCESS_WANTS_TOKEN`
- Update workflow to use custom token

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
cd /path/to/webwewant.fyi
node scripts/testWorkflow.js
```

Tests validate:
- ‚úÖ Want file generation with proper frontmatter
- ‚úÖ Duplicate detection against existing wants
- ‚úÖ Spam detection patterns
- ‚úÖ Content classification logic
- ‚úÖ Data validation

### Manual Testing
Test the webhook integration:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/WebWeWant/webwewant.fyi/dispatches \
  -d '@scripts/test-output/sample-webhook-payload.json'
```

## üìä Processing Results

After implementation, the workflow provides:

### Automatic Spam Filtering
- Detects promotional content, generic text, suspicious patterns
- Reduces manual review burden significantly
- Maintains audit trail of spam decisions

### Intelligent Categorization  
- Automatically applies technology-specific labels
- Ensures consistent tagging across submissions
- Improves want discoverability and organization

### Duplicate Prevention
- Compares against 180+ existing wants
- Uses tag overlap and content similarity scoring
- Prevents redundant submissions while allowing variations

### Quality Enhancement
- Edits submissions for clarity and completeness
- Adds relevant links to specifications and proposals
- Maintains consistent formatting and structure

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Review Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Review auto-generated issues for accuracy
2. **Monthly**: Assess spam detection effectiveness  
3. **Quarterly**: Update processing guidelines in `.github/instructions/wants-processing.instructions.md`

### Quality Metrics
- Monitor false positive/negative rates in spam detection
- Review duplicate detection accuracy
- Assess quality of generated want files
- Track processing time from submission to PR

### Maintenance Points
- Update `.github/instructions/wants-processing.instructions.md` as needed
- Add new technology labels when appropriate
- Refine duplicate detection thresholds
- Monitor GitHub API rate limits

Navigating my filesystem every time I need to upload something to a website is a time-consuming pain. When I click to upload a file—whether it's my resume for a job application, a photo for a profile, or a document for a form—the file browser always opens in my home folder or the last-used location. From there, I have to navigate through multiple folders to find what I need.

I want upload fields to provide hints about what type of file I'm uploading so the browser can intelligently open the file picker in the most appropriate folder. For example, when uploading a resume to a job application, the browser could open directly to my "Career" folder or wherever my resume is stored. When uploading a photo, it could open to my Pictures folder.

The browser could use various signals to determine the best location:
- Semantic hints from the webpage (e.g., `accept` attribute, form field labels, or additional metadata)
- User's file organization patterns and frequently accessed folders
- Previous upload history for similar file types
- Common file naming patterns (e.g., files containing "resume" or "CV")

This would save time and reduce friction in the upload process, making web forms feel more intelligent and user-friendly.

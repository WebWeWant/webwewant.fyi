You can make a div circular with 100% border-radius. But the text inside that div is not aware of the border-radius and continues to be a rectangle. 

Shaping text into a circle form requires two shape-outside elements, because there is no shape-inside OR built-in ability for text to respond to the actual shape of the div it's in. This is a real pain. 

What's the point of being able to make odd-shaped divs if you can't actually put anything inside of them?

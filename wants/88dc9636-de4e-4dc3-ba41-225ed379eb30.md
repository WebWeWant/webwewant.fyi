I frequently use the share functionality in mobile browsers to share URLs with different apps, typically switching between two or more apps depending on the context. Both Chrome and Firefox on Android automatically show the last app I shared to, but when I need to share to a different app, I have to expand the share menu to access more options.

Currently, Firefox displays a list of recently used apps in the share menu, which works perfectly for my use case. Chrome, however, doesn't provide this convenience, showing only the most recent target.

I would like browsers to make it easier for end-users to configure the share menu and to render the sharing interface more consistently across browsers. This would improve the user experience when using the Web Share API and make it more predictable regardless of which browser I'm using.

While this may seem like primarily an end-user concern rather than a developer feature request, consistency in how browsers implement web platform APIs like Web Share affects both the developer experience when building features and the user experience when using them. Standardizing the share menu behavior would benefit everyone working with and using the web platform.

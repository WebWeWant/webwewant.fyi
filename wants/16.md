The [`sandbox`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#attr-iframe-sandbox) attribute allows developers to restrict web features of embedded content, such as `<iframe>`. This is a hard-to-utilize security feature because code distributors do not provide sufficient documentation on the APIs used, likely leading to broken embeds. I want to be able to `sandbox` away with confidence!

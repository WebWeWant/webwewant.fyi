With the CSS property `resize` set to `horizontal` or `vertical` on elements with `overflow:hidden`, you get a little resize control in the bottom right of the element with which to resize it.

I think this should be a pseudo element just like `::marker` for list items and summary elements. This would allow it to be styled in ways that make sense for the current element as well as the current direction of resize when it's limited to a single dimension.

`::handle` as a pseudo-element to achieve this makes sense to me. I ran into this when writing [this article](https://polypane.app/blog/faking-container-queries-with-css-grid/), where I would really prefer to have a differently styled handle for the resizable examples.

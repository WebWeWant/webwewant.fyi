The lack of native support in HTML for including partials like nav menus, headers, footers, etc. makes it necessary to use static site generators, server-side programming, or JavaScript for client-side includes that slow down page rendering. For personal website operators using free hosts like NeoCities and NekoWeb, JavaScript is usually the only option for reusing snippets.

The submitter has explored workarounds using sed, m4, and hxincl in shell scripts to build their website, but these are not optimal solutions. Native HTML support for includes would eliminate the need for such workarounds and make it easier for developers to create maintainable websites without requiring complex build tools or server-side scripting.
